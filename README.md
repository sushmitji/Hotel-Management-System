# Hotel-Database-Management-System
## A website where customers could create an account and book rooms. Manager and Receptionists can administer the Hotel.

We (Team of three) have created a project using PHP, MySQL, MariaDB and Apache Server (using XAMPP) which simulates the booking process of a room in an hotel.

### Customers:
You can visit the website and create your own account. With this account, you can book rooms and view your booking history.

### Manager:
You can view all the employees currently working in the hotel and can edit their details. You can also view the reservations made by customers. You can view as well as change the details of the rooms. (Like room tariff, room view, etc)

### Receptionist:
You can view reservations made by the customers. You can view but cannot change the room details. You can prepare a bill for customer and can add extra charges for extra services used.


We have used a CSS template from w3schools. Javascript also used (for Date picker). mysqli Object oriented is used for connection to the database.
